### Brief over the project

For this overall project we got to work with the photography course to collaborate on two different projects. This was a great opportunity to work with like-minded people in a different field and to learn new interchangable skills. Along with working as a team in a new environment.

### Change By Design

This project let us explore our creativity. Performing a 360 rebrand of a company means no limits. From the colour scheme and logo to the business model they have, we got to change it however we liked. Working with the photographers made this project a lot more personal as the images were provided by them and not stock photography.

### Image Capture Library

In our teams we were given the brief to create a new, innovative picture library that focuses on one topic. Our group decided to go with a dessert/pastries library. This theme is fairly underrepresented with not many libraries portraying it. Therefore we found our gap in the market that we felt with our agency USP could be quite successful.

#### Backend edit

The main issue I had with the theme was the fact that the text or symbol within a button would not be centre and usually quite high up. This looked very unappealing and I wanted to change it, which I did through the css. Also, the text boxes in the UX building also couldn't be edited in terms of size, so I took to the css to change it.
